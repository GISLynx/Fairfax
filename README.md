# Fairfax County, Virginia.
<h1>Does having a higher education leads to higher income ?</h1>

<p>The purpose of this project is to analyze whether having higher education leads to higher income. To achieve this, I have downloaded several demographic data from the American Community Survey and shapefiles from Fairfax County, Virginia – Open Geospatial Data.  As a result, I have created a map and several graphics to show the conclusion of this research. </p>

<b>The relationship between higher education and average salary per district within Farifax County, VA</b>

<p>This map represents the average income in U.S. dollars, ranging from $103,000 to $163,000. It also shows the percentage of the population in each district with a bachelor’s degree or higher.

As you can observe, there is a clear divide between the north and south in terms of income. The wealthiest areas are in the fourth district in the north: Dranesville, Hunter Mill, Sully, and Springfield. On the other hand, the districts with the lowest average income are Mason, Franconia, Mount Vernon, and Braddock.

When you compare this data with the percentage of the population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher, there is a correlation between the two. As the level of education increases, income tends to increase as well. This trend is illustrated in the following charts:</p>

<p>There are two districts that are exceptions to the trend I explained earlier: Providence and Hunter Mill. As you can see, having the highest percentage of the population with higher education does not necessarily translate into higher average income. There are other variables missing. I think it would be interesting to conduct a local survey to find out what types of bachelor’s degrees are most common and to better understand the local job market and economy in general.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
All districts within Fairfax County have an average income that exceeds the national average. According to the American Census Bureau, the average income per household in the USA is $74,580. This means that even the district with the "lowest income" is still higher than the average for the rest of the country. </p>
